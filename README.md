Mentorship App

Designing a mentorship matching app, that would allow mentors to provide their services to mentees for free.  At this time, this mentorship app will provide mentorship services on interests in technology areas such as Python, React, Node JS etc.  We foresee an expansion to other fields in the future.

MVP
Both mentors and mentees sign up for an account.
A mentor can find a mentee/s.
A mentee can find a mentor/s.
Both parties are able to look for matches based on interests tags set.
All users should sign up and have profile accounts. 
Question and answers board.
Once matched, either party can request to connect.
If connection is accepted, a private chat room is created.
The chat history will show in both their profile pages.

Pivot feature:
Users will have the ability to rank mentors.


Post MVP
More profile details and images/avatar.
Geolocation for ease of in-person meet.
Be able to provide reviews for good/exceptional mentors.
